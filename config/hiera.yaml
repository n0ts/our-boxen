# This file configures the hiera "database" for Boxen. As with most files in
# this repo, it's just an example, and you should feel free to make any
# changes suited to your organisation.

# The defaults here should give you a solid start; put global defaults in
# a file named hiera/common.yaml, and individuals can supplement and/or override
# them in hiera/{github_login}.yaml
